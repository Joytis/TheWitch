Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## What this is

A **Slay the Spire 2 character mod** ("TheWitch") built from the Alchyr Sts2 BaseLib template. It is a Godot 4.5 / C# (net9.0) project that compiles to a `.dll` + `.pck` loaded by the game at runtime via Harmony patching. There is no standalone runnable app — output is consumed by Slay the Spire 2.

## Build & run

```bash
dotnet build          # compiles, then auto-copies .dll/.pdb/.json into the game's mods/ folder
dotnet publish        # build + invokes headless Godot to export the .pck (full asset packaging)
```

- **Build = deploy.** The `CopyToModsFolderOnBuild` target copies outputs straight into `<Sts2Path>/mods/TheWitch/`. To test in-game: build, then launch Slay the Spire 2.
- The game dir is auto-discovered from the Steam registry/library by [Sts2PathDiscovery.props](Sts2PathDiscovery.props). Override via a `local.props` or `/p:Sts2Path=...` if discovery fails.
- `dotnet publish` requires a real Godot mono executable; path is set in [Directory.Build.props](Directory.Build.props) (`GodotPath`). **Must be Godot 4.5.x** — the game refuses `.pck` files exported by a newer Godot.
- Build references `sts2.dll` and `0Harmony.dll` from the installed game; building fails with a clear error if the game isn't found.
- No test suite. Validation is manual in-game.

## Architecture

The mod assembly is **not** the game's assembly. Game types live under `MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.*`; the BaseLib helper layer under `BaseLib.*`. All mod code is in [TheWitchCode/](TheWitchCode/); all assets/data in [TheWitch/](TheWitch/).

**Entry point:** [MainFile.cs](TheWitchCode/MainFile.cs) is marked `[ModInitializer]`. Its only job is `harmony.PatchAll()` — all integration with the game happens through BaseLib's model registration + Harmony patches, not a main loop.

**Content model pattern.** Each content type has an abstract mod-base class that wires up asset paths, then concrete content subclasses it:
- [Cards/WitchCard.cs](TheWitchCode/Cards/WitchCard.cs) → `CustomCardModel`
- [Powers/WitchPower.cs](TheWitchCode/Powers/WitchPower.cs) → `CustomPowerModel`
- [Relics/WitchRelic.cs](TheWitchCode/Relics/WitchRelic.cs) → `CustomRelicModel`
- [Potions/WitchPotion.cs](TheWitchCode/Potions/WitchPotion.cs) → `CustomPotionModel`

Create new content by subclassing the relevant base in its folder (the BaseLib `ModAnalyzers` and IDE templates assist). Models are looked up at runtime via `ModelDb.Card<T>()`, `ModelDb.Relic<T>()`, etc.

**Pools.** [Character/](TheWitchCode/Character/) defines the character and its `CardPool`/`RelicPool`/`PotionPool`. Content is bound to a pool with the `[Pool(typeof(...))]` attribute on the base class — so individual cards/relics inherit pool membership and don't declare it themselves. [Character/Witch.cs](TheWitchCode/Character/Witch.cs) (`PlaceholderCharacterModel`) defines starting HP/deck/relics and references the pools; it currently uses base-game Ironclad placeholders.

**Asset path convention (important).** Content classes derive their image path from `Id.Entry` — the model id, lowercased with the mod prefix stripped (`RemovePrefix().ToLowerInvariant()`). So a card with id `THEWITCH-Foo` loads `TheWitch/images/card_portraits/foo.png` (and `big/foo.png` for full art). Path helpers live in [Extensions/StringExtensions.cs](TheWitchCode/Extensions/StringExtensions.cs); they fall back to a default placeholder image and log when a file is missing. Add art at the matching path rather than overriding the path methods.

**Localization** is JSON under [TheWitch/localization/eng/](TheWitch/localization/) (`cards.json`, `powers.json`, `relics.json`, `characters.json`, keywords, hover tips). Keys follow `THEWITCH-<ENTRY>.<field>`. These files are fed to the BaseLib analyzer (`AdditionalFiles` in the csproj) so missing/extra localization is caught at build time.

## Content creation

The mod's `Custom{Card,Relic,Potion,Power}Model` bases are thin wrappers over the game's `MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Models.{CardModel,RelicModel,PotionModel,PowerModel}`. All content shares one root, `AbstractModel`. Two facts drive everything:

- **Registration is reflection-based.** `ModelDb` discovers content via `ReflectionHelper.GetSubtypesInMods<AbstractModel>()` and instantiates with a parameterless ctor. Subclassing a model base + binding it to a pool (`[Pool]`) is the entire "registration" — there is no manual register call.
- **Behavior is hook overrides, not a loop.** `AbstractModel` exposes ~100 async `Task` event hooks (`BeforeCombatStart`, `AfterDamageGiven`, `AfterCardPlayed`, `AfterPlayerTurnStart`, …) plus ~40 synchronous `Modify*` hooks (`ModifyDamageAdditive`, `ModifyEnergyGain`, …). Relics/powers react by overriding the relevant hook. `ShouldReceiveCombatHooks` gates delivery (relics/potions always; cards only while in a combat pile).

**What you override per type:**
- **Card** → ctor `base(energyCost, type, rarity, targetType)`, `CanonicalVars` (the numbers), `OnPlay(ctx, cardPlay)` (the effect), `OnUpgrade()`. Optional: `CanonicalKeywords`, `CanonicalTags`, `MaxUpgradeLevel`, `HasEnergyCostX`, `CanonicalStarCost`.
- **Relic** → abstract `Rarity` + hook overrides. Instant pickup effects use `HasUponPickupEffect` + `AfterObtained()`. Counter relics use `ShowCounter`/`DisplayAmount`.
- **Potion** → abstract `Rarity`/`Usage`/`TargetType` + `OnUse(ctx, target)`. Use `PotionRarity.Token` (or `Event`) for a potion that should only be granted by a card/relic/effect and never appear as a random drop — see the pool-gating gotcha below.

**Stats live in `DynamicVars`.** `CanonicalVars` returns typed vars (`DamageVar`, `BlockVar`, `PowerVar<T>`, `CardsVar`, …) keyed by name; `DynamicVars.Damage` etc. resolve by that key (`PowerVar<VulnerablePower>` → `DynamicVars.Vulnerable`). The same vars are the tokens referenced in the localization JSON, and `UpgradeValueBy` drives green upgrade previews. `ValueProp` (`Move`/`Unpowered`) controls power scaling of the displayed number.

**Effects go through `Cmd` families, never raw state writes:** `DamageCmd.Attack(n).FromCard(this).Targeting(t).Execute(ctx)`, `PowerCmd.Apply<TPower>(...)`, `CreatureCmd.GainBlock(...)`, `CardCmd`/`CardPileCmd`/`CardSelectCmd`. State mutation is guarded by `AssertMutable()` (canonical instances are immutable; real instances are mutable clones).

**Decompiled game source is the reference.** A full decompile lives at `gamedata/` (**gitignored** — local-only, not committed; it's proprietary game code). The ~400 base-game content classes under `gamedata/src/Core/Models/{Cards,Relics,Potions,Powers}/` are the authoritative examples. Workflow: find the closest base-game class, copy its pattern into a `CustomXModel` subclass here, swap the pool + localization keys. Do **not** paste verbatim decompiled code into tracked files.

## Card design docs (keep `cards.json` in sync)

Every card is documented in **`Docs/card-data/cards.json`** (source of truth), rendered by an interactive page `Docs/card-designs.html` with copy-to-console buttons + a `TESTED` flag. The `card-designs` skill drives it.

**Whenever you add, remove, or change a card** (cost/type/rarity/target/`CanonicalVars`/`OnUpgrade`/localization text), regenerate the data so the docs stay current:
```bash
node Docs/card-data/regen.js          # rebuild cards.json from the .cs files + localization
node Docs/card-data/regen.js --check  # no-write drift check (exit 1 if stale)
```
`regen.js` parses the card classes, **preserves each card's `tested` flag, `artFinal` flag, and curated `note`**, and **auto-clears `TESTED` for any card whose mechanics changed** — that is the user's "clear TESTED when the design changes" rule, automated. Treat running `regen.js` as part of finishing any card edit (alongside `dotnet build`) — **especially batches of card changes**: the regenerated data feeds the live, team-facing art tracker (below), so skipping it leaves the published design/status page stale. Do not hand-maintain a parallel markdown list — `cards.json` is the only card doc.

**Art tracker (live, GitHub-Pages-served).** `regen.js` also chains `Docs/art-tracker/regen-art-tracker.js`, which rewrites **`pages/art-tracker.html`** — the static team-facing art-status page, published at `https://joytis.github.io/TheWicken/pages/art-tracker.html` (root `index.html` links to it; Pages serves `main` branch from `/ (root)`). The page is only as current as the last **pushed** regen — after a batch of card edits, regen + commit + push is what actually updates the live view. The `/regen` skill drives this. Details:
- Tabs: Cards (from `cards.json`) + Potions / Relics / Familiar Pets / Character & UI (from hand-maintained **`Docs/art-tracker/assets.json`**).
- Per-card artist + art brief live in **`Docs/art-tracker/card-briefs.json`** — authored via the card-designs page (`Docs/card-designs.cmd`, Witch tab: inline Artist / Art Brief fields, saved through `server.js`'s `/api/brief`; the server also debounce-regens the tracker after any write).
- **Status is derived, never stored**: `artFinal`/`done: true` → Done (green); `artist` set → In Progress (yellow); else Placeholder (grey).
- The generator prints `MISSING IMAGE FILES` (expected PNG absent → "no art" tile); surface notable ones.

**Card categorization + base-class study.** Each card in `cards.json` also carries `mechanics[]` (Brambles/Potions/Familiars) and `role[]` (Generator/Payoff/Enabler/Token/Standalone) tags for reasoning about pool makeup; `card-designs.html` renders a Mechanic × Role matrix. The page additionally has **read-only tabs for the base-game classes** (Silent, Necrobinder, Ironclad) — data in `Docs/card-data/{silent,necrobinder,ironclad}.json`, regenerated by `node Docs/card-data/gen-basegame.js` from `gamedata/` (tags preserved across runs). The design lessons distilled from that study (the "payoff cluster" test for what counts as a pillar, self-acting vs spend-it gen:payoff ratios, neutral-filler share) live in **[Docs/class-pool-analysis.md](Docs/class-pool-analysis.md)** — read it before proposing new Witch mechanics.

## Potion orientation & brewing

Potions are a core character identity, so there's a dedicated system to **classify potions by orientation** and **brew / upgrade** them — see [Docs/potion-brewing-system.md](Docs/potion-brewing-system.md) for the design record. Code: [TheWitchCode/Potions/Brewing/](TheWitchCode/Potions/Brewing/).

- **`PotionOrientation`** (`Offensive` / `Defensive` / `Utility` / `Neutral`) is the *only* axis the system uses. An earlier fine-grained `PotionTrait` `[Flags]` taxonomy was **deliberately collapsed away** — matching on sub-traits made the brew/upgrade pools too narrow (a Heal potion only ever upgraded into the single Uncommon healer). `PotionTraits.OrientationOf(potion)` classifies *any* potion (base-game or modded) — **manual table first, inference fallback**: the hand-curated `PotionTraits.Manual` table (keyed by model `Type`, one `// description` per row) is authoritative; any potion **not** in it falls back to `Derive` (from its typed `DynamicVars` + `TargetType`). **Every potion the mod ships must have a `Manual` entry.**
- **`PotionCatalog.Query(orientation:, rarity:, usage:, randomizableOnly:)`** filters the **`Randomizable`** pool = `WitchAndShared` (the mod's `WitchPotionPool` + base-game `SharedPotionPool`) at Common/Uncommon/Rare — so brew/make-potion effects **never** pull other characters' potions or Token/Event payloads. **`BrewBook.Brew(a, b, rng)`** combines two potions (output rarity = highest + 1, capped Rare; **same-orientation** → rarity-only fallback) and returns a real existing potion. **`PotionUpgrade.UpgradeRandomPotions(player, rng, count)`** upgrades N random belt potions by brewing each *with itself* (rarity +1, same orientation, excludes the input). All return *canonical* models — `.ToMutable()` + `PotionCmd.TryToProcure` to grant.
- **"Make a potion of orientation X" cards** (Something Wicked = Offensive, Toil and Trouble = Utility, Stone Skin = Defensive) just `PotionCatalog.Random(PotionCatalog.Query(orientation:, rarity:), rng)` — always `Random`, never `FirstOrDefault` (that yields the same potion every time).
- **Dev console** (subclass `AbstractConsoleCmd`; debug-console only): `potiontraits` dumps every potion's orientation by rarity; `mergepotions` brews the first two belt potions. Code in [TheWitchCode/DevConsole/](TheWitchCode/DevConsole/).

## SFX / VFX

Base-game sfx/vfx API + reusable asset catalog: **[Docs/sfx-vfx-catalog.md](Docs/sfx-vfx-catalog.md)** (attack-builder `WithHitFx`/`WithHitVfxNode`, `VfxCmd` paths, `N*Vfx` node factories + which are globally preloaded, FMOD event strings, debug mp3s). Witch house palette + per-card assignments: [Docs/sfx-vfx-proposal.md](Docs/sfx-vfx-proposal.md). Shared mechanic signatures (familiar summon flourish, brew puff, spore puff, hex gaze, bramble slice) live in [Extensions/WitchFx.cs](TheWitchCode/Extensions/WitchFx.cs) — use those helpers, don't hand-roll per card. Gotchas: non-globally-preloaded `N*Vfx` need `ExtraRunAssetPaths` on the card (powers have no such hook — power-spawned vfx must be globally preloaded or registered by the granting card); block/heal/buff/debuff/potion-procure sounds are automatic — never re-add.

## Familiars

The signature mechanic. A **summon Power card** (`WolfFamiliar`, `BearFamiliar`, …, all marked `IFamiliarSummon`) applies one stack of a **`FamiliarPower`** counter via `WitchCard.GainFamiliar<TPower>()`. At each turn start every `FamiliarPower` adds one **token card** to your hand **per stack** (`AfterPlayerTurnStart`). Code: [TheWitchCode/Powers/FamiliarPower.cs](TheWitchCode/Powers/FamiliarPower.cs); summon cards in [TheWitchCode/Cards/](TheWitchCode/Cards/), token cards under `Cards/Familiar/`.

- **Three power bases** (all in `FamiliarPower.cs`): `FamiliarPower<TCard>` (always one token type — Owl→Wisdom, Wolf→Gnash); `LootTableFamiliarPower` (weighted table via `FamiliarLootTable.Add<TCard>(weight)` — Bear, Crow); plain `FamiliarPower` (override `CreateTurnStartCard` for custom rolls — Chimera pulls the whole pool).
- **Token cards** subclass `WitchFamiliarCard` (in the shared `WitchFamiliarCardPool`, `IsShared => true`, `Token` rarity). The base grants **Exhaust** to every token by default (one-shot per-turn payloads — don't clog the deck); a token needing extra keywords must re-include `Exhaust` in its own `CanonicalKeywords`.
- **Generate, don't Add.** Turn-start tokens go in via `CardPileCmd.AddGeneratedCardToCombat(card, PileType.Hand, player)` — NOT plain `Add`. Only the generated path fires `AfterCardGeneratedForCombat` + records combat history, which card-creation payoffs (Cloak of Moonlight) listen to. Plain `Add` is for *moving existing* cards (Find Familiar / Pact of Beasts tutor `IFamiliarSummon` cards from your piles).
- **Upgraded summons grant upgraded tokens.** `FamiliarPower.GrantsUpgradedCards` (set by `GainFamiliar` when the summon card `IsUpgraded`) flows into every `CreateFamiliarCards` / loot-table call. Summon-card hover tips preview it with `HoverTipFactory.FromCard<X>(IsUpgraded)`. (Caveat: that flag is plain power state, not in `DynamicVars` — not serialized for save/MP.)
- **Cosmetic pets**: each `FamiliarPower` declares `protected abstract WitchPet Pet`; the base spawns it on `AfterApplied` and despawns it (`CreatureCmd.Kill`) on `AfterRemoved` (last stack lost). Pets reuse the base-game rocket `creature_visuals` with a swapped sprite — see [Monsters/WitchPetVisualsPatch.cs](TheWitchCode/Monsters/WitchPetVisualsPatch.cs).

## Conventions & gotchas

- `Nullable` is enabled and `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>` is not, but the BaseLib analyzers surface mod-specific mistakes — read analyzer warnings.
- The csproj **excludes** `TheWitch/**`, `materials/`, `shaders/`, `images/` from compilation — that tree is Godot assets, not C#. Don't put `.cs` there.
- `TheWitch.json` is the mod manifest (id, version, `min_game_version`, BaseLib dependency). The build auto-syncs the BaseLib `min_version` in this file to the actually-restored package version (`UpdateDependencyVersions` target) — don't hand-edit that field.
- The mod id `"TheWitch"` (in [MainFile.cs](TheWitchCode/MainFile.cs)) is the resource path root (`res://TheWitch`) and Harmony id; keep it in sync with the manifest and folder name.
- `git` is configured to normalize all text to LF ([.gitattributes](.gitattributes)).
- **A number that scales with combat state must display *live* via `CalculatedDamageVar`, not by mutating `BaseValue`.** Use the base-game Soul Storm shape: `CalculationBaseVar(base)` + `ExtraDamageVar(perUnit)` + `CalculatedDamageVar(prop).WithMultiplier((card, _) => <count>)`; `OnPlay` deals `DynamicVars.CalculatedDamage`, `OnUpgrade` bumps `DynamicVars.ExtraDamage`. Mutating `DynamicVars.Damage.BaseValue` at runtime (the "Maul" buff-every-copy pattern) does **not** reliably re-render and breaks outright for `Exhaust` cards that respawn each turn (e.g. Gnash). Reference: [Cards/Familiar/Gnash.cs](TheWitchCode/Cards/Familiar/Gnash.cs).
- **Localization for a created/added card that can be upgraded** uses the base-game convention `[gold]{IfUpgraded:show:Name+|Name}[/gold]` — the card name gains a `+` and stays `[gold]`; the `+` *is* the upgrade marker (never `[green]`; that's only for flavor/prose). Base-game examples: `REAVE`, `DIRGE`, `HIDDEN_DAGGERS`. Pair it with `HoverTipFactory.FromCard<T>(IsUpgraded)` on the source card so the preview matches.
- **Combat-scoped persistent effects revert in `AfterCombatEnd`.** To grant something for one fight only, apply a tracker power that undoes it at combat end rather than leaving run-level state mutated — e.g. the cut Roomy Satchel card granted potion slots + applied a tracker power whose `AfterCombatEnd` called `LoseMaxPotionCount(Amount)` (pattern lives in git history: `RoomySatchelPower`). The decrement-to-zero auto-remove path fires `AfterRemoved`, the combat-end teardown fires `AfterCombatEnd`.
- **Art is authored "big" and scaled down.** Author `images/.../big/<name>.png`; generate the small variant with `py tools/gen-image-sizes.py big/<name>.png` (single-image mode reuses the existing small's dimensions, else falls back to ¼). No-arg runs the bulk both-sizes pass over all categories.
- **Pool membership ≠ random availability for potions.** `[Pool]` on the base registers content; for potions, *random* drop/shop availability is gated separately by **rarity**. `PotionFactory.CreateRandomPotion` only ever rolls `Common`/`Uncommon`/`Rare` (combat drops *and* merchant stock both route through it), so a potion with rarity `PotionRarity.Token` or `Event` is never generated randomly while remaining registered — so `PotionCmd.TryToProcure<T>()` from a card/relic still grants it. This is how you make a **card-only payload potion** (base-game example: `PotionShapedRock` = `Token`; `FoulPotion`/`GlowwaterPotion` = `Event`). Don't try to exclude it by removing `[Pool]` — that unregisters it and breaks `TryToProcure`.
- **Potions serialize as id + slot ONLY** (`SerializablePotion` in `gamedata/src/Core/Saves/Runs/`) — no per-potion state survives save/quit/resume or syncs in MP. Any stateful potion (e.g. The Cauldron's poured effects, stored in the mutable instance's `DynamicVars`) silently resets to canonical on reload. Same caveat class as `FamiliarPower.GrantsUpgradedCards`. If persistence matters, use the sidecar-save pattern in [Potions/CauldronSavePatch.cs](TheWitchCode/Potions/CauldronSavePatch.cs) (user-dir JSON keyed by `PlayerRng.Seed` + slot; write on `Player.ToSerializable`, restore on private `Player.LoadPotions`) — still not MP-synced.
- **Mid-combat state never restores in single-player — extra power-instance fields are safe there.** Run saves contain NO combat state at all (`SerializableRoom` = room type + encounter id + rewards; no creatures/powers/piles), so save/quit/resume restarts the encounter fresh. Live MP is deterministic lockstep (`ActionQueueSynchronizer`) — every client runs the same hooks, so plain C# fields on a power instance (NeverendingPotionPower's bottled list, `FamiliarPower.GrantsUpgradedCards`) stay consistent across clients. The ONLY loss path: **mid-combat MP rejoin** — `ClientRejoinResponseMessage` restores combat from `NetFullCombatState`, whose `PowerState` is `{id, amount}` only, so the rejoining client rebuilds powers with stacks but empty instance state (accepted trade-off; other clients unaffected).
- **Conditional loc text**: the loc engine is SmartFormat with `ConditionalFormatter` registered — `{Var:cond:>0?shown when positive|}` (also `==1?`, `<0?`, chained options). Base-game examples: `SOVEREIGN_BLADE`, `SHRINK_POWER`, `DEXTERITY_POWER`. Lets a tooltip hide zero-valued effect lines entirely (The Cauldron).
- **Live *hit-count* display = the base-game Barrage pattern** (complement to the Soul Storm damage shape): `CalculationBaseVar(0m)` + `CalculationExtraVar(1m)` + `new CalculatedVar("CalculatedHits").WithMultiplier((card, _) => <count>)`; `OnPlay` reads `(int)((CalculatedVar)DynamicVars["CalculatedHits"]).Calculate(target)` for `WithHitCount`. Loc shows it in-combat only: `{InCombat:\n(Hits {CalculatedHits:diff()} {CalculatedHits:plural:time|times})|}`. Reference: `gamedata` `Barrage.cs`; mod example [Cards/BottleBarrage.cs](TheWitchCode/Cards/BottleBarrage.cs).
- **Front-of-hand insertion is a built-in param**: `CardPileCmd.AddGeneratedCardToCombat(card, PileType.Hand, player, CardPilePosition.Top)` (enum: `Bottom` default / `Top` / `Random`). No patch needed.
- **Belt-shrink trap:** `Player.SetMaxPotionCountInternal` migrates potions from doomed slots into earlier empty slots **silently — no event fires**. Any UI code that trims potion holders must re-seat stranded potion nodes against `player.PotionSlots` or the migrated potion's node is freed with its holder (invisible + unusable until reload). (Reference fix in git history: `PotionBeltShrinkPatch.cs`, cut with Roomy Satchel — nothing shrinks the belt anymore.)
- **Localization keys share ONE namespace across `cards.json`/`potions.json`/`powers.json`** — keys are id-derived (`THEWITCH-<ENTRY>.*`), so a card and a potion cannot both be named e.g. `WickedBrew` (both would claim `THEWITCH-WICKED_BREW.title`). Rename one class before reusing a display name (this is why the Wicked Brew *potion* became `NoxiousBrew`).
- **Encounter tier** = `Owner.RunState.CurrentMapPoint?.PointType` (`MapPointType.Monster`/`Elite`/`Boss`/…). Nullable — guard with `?.` and default the `switch` (Extract Essence pattern: Boss→Rare, Elite→Uncommon, else Common).
- **No native cost-substitution hook exists** ("pay X resource instead of Energy"). The working shape (Bonfire): `TryModifyEnergyCostInCombat` zeroes the cost while affordable and remembers the card in a transient `HashSet<CardModel>`; `BeforeCardPlayed` consumes the set entry and spends the resource. Guard `originalCost > 0` so natively-free cards don't pay, and never let re-applying the power stack its price. See [Powers/BonfirePower.cs](TheWitchCode/Powers/BonfirePower.cs).
- Handy: `list.UnstableShuffle(rng)` (in `MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Extensions`) is the game's own in-place shuffle — use it instead of hand-rolling Fisher–Yates. (`BramblesPower` now lives in `TheWitch.TheWitchCode.Powers` like every other mod power — it was migrated out of the game's `MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Models.Powers` namespace, and its loc keys are `THEWITCH-BRAMBLES_POWER.*`. The model-id prefix is derived from the namespace root, so never declare mod types in `MegaCrit.*` namespaces.)
- **A custom card pool must reach `ModelDb.AllCardPools`, or its cards crash on render with `InvalidOperationException: You monster!`.** `AllCardPools = AllCharacterCardPools.Concat(AllSharedCardPools)`. A pool only enters `AllCharacterCardPools` if some `CharacterModel.CardPool` returns it (one pool per character), and only enters `AllSharedCardPools` if it overrides `IsShared => true` (which calls `ModelDbSharedCardPoolsPatch.Register` from the `CustomCardPoolModel` ctor). A pool that is *neither* referenced by a character *nor* shared is invisible. `CardModel.Pool` then finds no pool, falls through to the `MockCardPool` branch, and `MockCardPool.GenerateAllCards()` calls `NeverEverCallThisOutsideOfTests_ClearOwner()` → **"You monster!"** — and it fires on *render/hover*, not on play (e.g. a `HoverTipFactory.FromCard<T>` preview). **Secondary/utility pools that aren't a character's main `CardPool` (familiar, spawned, token-payload cards) must be `IsShared => true`** — mirrors base-game shared pools `ColorlessCardPool`/`StatusCardPool`/`TokenCardPool`. Token rarity still keeps such cards out of random rewards. (Fixed: [Character/WitchFamiliarCardPool.cs](TheWitchCode/Character/WitchFamiliarCardPool.cs) for `Wisdom`, a `Token` familiar previewed by `OwlFamiliar`.)

## Task workflow (TODO loop)

Backlog work for this mod runs through a saved loop — the **`todo-loop`** skill ([.claude/skills/todo-loop/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/todo-loop/SKILL.md)) plus three docs under [Docs/](Docs/):
- **`TODO_STAGING.md`** — raw-notes inbox; the user drops half-formed ideas here.
- **`TODO.md`** — formatted, prioritized queue; its header holds the loop protocol.
- **`DONE.md`** — completed items (what changed, the design calls made, verification).

Procedure: ingest each staging note into a self-contained `TODO.md` item (then delete that line from staging); claim the top item (`IN PROGRESS`), implement, `dotnet build` green is the gate, move it to `DONE.md`. Flag truncated/ambiguous notes as `BLOCKED` and ask rather than guess; serialize shared-JSON edits but parallelize file-isolated work. Run `/todo-loop` to drive it.
