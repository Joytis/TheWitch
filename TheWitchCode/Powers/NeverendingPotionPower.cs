/// <summary>
/// Neverending Potion: holds the consumed potion instances captured by <see cref="CrystalBottlePower" /> and
/// replays each one's effect at the start of the player's turn (in the AutoPrePlay phase — the game's hook for
/// turn-start effects that may auto-play cards, e.g. a bottled Distilled Chaos; replaying in AfterPlayerTurnStart
/// ran during the Start phase and locked the turn: the phase never advanced to Play, so no cards could be
/// played). Replay targeting: single-enemy potions hit a
/// random living enemy (re-rolled each turn); self/player potions target the owner; everything else
/// (AllEnemies/None) passes no target and lets the potion's own OnUse fan out. Replays invoke the protected
/// <c>PotionModel.OnUse</c> directly via reflection (<c>OnUseWrapper</c> would throw in
/// <c>RemoveBeforeUse</c> on the already-removed potion and re-fire <c>AfterPotionUsed</c>).
/// MP: each replay runs under its OWN <see cref="HookPlayerChoiceContext" /> (the Hook.AfterDeath pattern),
/// NOT the shared turn-start context. The shared context supports exactly one player-choice game action for
/// the whole turn-start window; a second selection (two bottled draft potions, or one plus any other
/// turn-start choice) hits its "Tried to interrupt action" error path and the selection opens unsynced —
/// breaking multiplayer. With a per-potion context, a selection-prompting replay pauses into its own queued
/// CombatPlayPhaseOnly action and resolves at the start of the Play phase, like Mayhem-style effects.
/// Amount mirrors the bottled count for display; the list is plain power state (not DynamicVars), so it does
/// not survive save/reload or sync in MP — same caveat class as FamiliarPower.GrantsUpgradedCards.
