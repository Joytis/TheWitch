# Card Implementation Plan — `import/STS2 TheWicken - Cards.csv`

Durable TODO + design record for implementing the 56 designed cards. One row in the
CSV (Bear Familiar's upgrade) is a line-continuation, so the count is **56 cards**,
not 57.

## Progress log

- **2026-06-25** — Plan ingested (56 cards). Decisions Q1/Q3 made (below). **Phase 0 — Familiar power
  system built & compiling:**
  - `Powers/FamiliarPower.cs` — abstract counter base; one stack = one familiar of that type.
  - `Powers/OwlFamiliarPower.cs`, `Powers/CatFamiliarPower.cs` — concrete powers for existing familiars.
  - `Powers/Familiars.cs` — `Count` / `On` / `Any` / `RemoveRandom(rng)` helpers (familiar count = sum
    of all `FamiliarPower` stacks; sacrifice = decrement a random one, auto-removed at 0).
  - `Cards/WickenCard.cs` — `GainFamiliar<TPower>()` helper; wired into `OwlFamiliar` + `CatFamiliar`.
  - Loc added for both powers in `powers.json`. **Each new familiar card must add its own
    `XFamiliarPower` + loc + a `GainFamiliar<>` call.**
- **2026-06-25 (cont.) — more Phase 0 infra built & compiling:**
  - `Extensions/CombatHistoryQueries.cs` — history-backed counters (no tracker powers needed):
    `PotionsUsedThisTurn`, `BramblesCreatedThisTurn`. Pattern reusable for any "X this turn/combat"
    via `CombatManager.Instance.History` + `entry.Actor` + `HappenedThisTurn(state)`.
  - `Powers/ViciousBarbsPower.cs` + `Powers/HedgePrisonPower.cs` + edited `Powers/BramblesPower.cs`
    so bramble retaliation reads them (Vicious Barbs = +Amount damage per trigger; Hedge Prison =
    skip decrement / permanent). Loc added. **Cards Vicious Barbs / Hedge Prison now reduce to a
    one-line `PowerCmd.Apply<>` Power card.**
  - `Cards/IFamiliarSummon.cs` — marker on familiar-summon cards (Owl, Cat implement it). Enables
    Broom Strike / Pact of Beasts to detect familiar powers generically.
- **2026-06-25 (Phase 1) — 16 quick-win cards built, compiling 0/0, placeholder big art + loc done:**
  Serrated Bones, Lavender and Sage, Nettles, Brambleburst, Wild Growth, Needle Whip, Forbidden Magic,
  Stuck in the Bush, Moondrop Tea, Hexburst, Something Wicked, Toil and Trouble, Blood Boiling,
  Rattling Bottles, Bag of Teeth, Hidden in Smoke. All `WickenCard` → auto-pooled via inherited
  `[Pool(WickenCardPool)]`; placeholder `big/<snake>.png` copies (no `.import` — Godot regenerates on
  publish); loc in `cards.json`.
  - Patterns established for reuse: AoE attack `DamageCmd.Attack(..).TargetingAllOpponents(CombatState!)`;
    multi-hit `.WithHitCount(DynamicVars["Repeat"].IntValue)` + `{Repeat:diff()} {Repeat:plural:time|times}`;
    bramble-scaling via `Owner.Creature.GetPowerAmount<BramblesPower>()`; self life-loss `HpLossVar` +
    `CreatureCmd.Damage(.. Unblockable|Unpowered ..)`; offensive/utility potion create via
    `PotionCatalog.Query(PotionTrait.X, matchAll:false, rarity)` + `PotionCatalog.Random`.
  - **Enemy "lose Strength this turn"**: `Powers/NeedleWhipStrengthPower.cs` = `TemporaryStrengthPower`
    (IsPositive=false) **+ `ICustomModel`** (BaseLib prefix marker — required for mod powers that can't
    extend `CustomPowerModel`; silences STS003; uses shared temp-strength loc, no powers.json entry).
    Reuse this pattern for any future temp-stat card.
- **2026-06-26 (Phase 2) — 3 brambles cards built on Phase 0 infra, compiling 0/0, art + loc done:**
  - `Cards/BrambleShield.cs` — 7 block + (PerBramble × `CombatHistoryQueries.BramblesCreatedThisTurn`).
    Bonus block computed in OnPlay via `GainBlock(creature, decimal, ValueProp.Move, cardPlay)`; the card
    preview shows only the base 7 (no live scaling) — fine for placeholder, could move to a `CalculatedVar`
    later if live preview is wanted.
  - `Cards/ViciousBarbs.cs` — applies `ViciousBarbsPower` (3, +2 upg).
  - `Cards/HedgePrison.cs` — applies `HedgePrisonPower` (toggle; -1 energy upg).
  - Both Power cards are one-liners over the Phase 0 powers, exactly as predicted. Power tooltips
    (powers.json desc for VICIOUS_BARBS_POWER/HEDGE_PRISON_POWER) left empty — card text carries the
    explanation; fill power descriptions later for polish.
- **2026-06-26 (Phase 3) — 6 trigger cards + powers built, compiling 0/0, art + loc done.** Each card
  applies a persistent `WickenPower` that overrides one global combat hook:
  - `RottingRootsPower` — `AfterPowerAmountChanged`, filter `applier==Owner && power.Owner!=Owner &&
    Type==Debuff && amount>0` → gain Brambles (excludes self-debuffs; brambles is Buff so no loop).
  - `CursedBloodlinePower` / `BindInBloodPower` — `AfterDamageReceived`, `target==Owner &&
    result.UnblockedDamage>0`. Cursed = flat per event; Bind = `Amount × UnblockedDamage`, self-removes
    via `AfterSideTurnEnd` (turn-scoped; **not** `ITemporaryPower` — that contract is for stat-wrapping
    powers).
  - `BottomlessCauldronPower` / `BitterRootPower` — `AfterPotionUsed`, `potion.Owner==Owner.Player`.
    These hooks have **no PlayerChoiceContext** → use `new ThrowingPlayerChoiceContext()` (Bitter Root);
    `TryToProcure<WickedBrew>(Player)` needs none (Bottomless).
  - `CloakOfMoonlightPower` — both `AfterCardGeneratedForCombat` (creator==player) and
    `AfterPotionProcured` (potion.Owner==player) → gain Block.
  - Reusable note: global hooks (`AfterPowerAmountChanged`, `AfterDamageReceived`, `AfterPotionUsed`,
    `AfterPotionProcured`, `AfterCardGeneratedForCombat`) are delivered to every combat-hook model — a
    listener power just filters by `Owner`. Hooks without a context use `ThrowingPlayerChoiceContext`.
- **2026-06-26 (Phase 4) — 5 of 8 potion cards built, 0/0:** Bottle Wall (`PotionsUsedThisTurn`),
  Herbal Remedy + Unstable Reaction (`PotionCmd.Discard` all belt potions, then energy / AoE per),
  Dance Around the Cauldron (`DanceAroundTheCauldronPower`, end-of-turn `AfterSideTurnEnd` reads
  `PlayerCombatState.Energy`, procures Wicked Brews, self-removes), Roomy Satchel
  (`PlayerCmd.GainMaxPotionCount`). **Deferred (need infra/design):** Bottle Barrage (no potions-created
  history → tracker), Witch's Curse (no way to tag "potion damage" — damage from potions carries no
  potion source), Gather Herbs ("higher quality" potion-upgrade semantics undefined). **Watch:** Roomy
  Satchel raises run-level max potion count (persists; could stack if duplicated) — flagged in card.
- **2026-06-26 (Phase 5) — familiars + tokens built, 0/0.** APIs: `CreatureCmd.Heal`,
  `PlayerCmd.GainGold`, ignore-block = `CreatureCmd.Damage(.. Move|Unblockable)` (no attack-builder
  option exists), tokens added to hand via `AddGeneratedCardsToCombat(.., PileType.Hand, ..)`.
  - **5 familiars** (each: `XFamiliarPower` + `GainFamiliar<>` + `IFamiliarSummon` + token spawn, **no
    pet sprite** — cosmetic, skipped): Rat→Plague×3, Porcupine→Quills×2, Bear→Hibernate+Mutilate,
    Crow→Scout×2, Sloth→Laze×2. Token "+" upgrades flow through `CreateFamiliarCards(.., IsUpgraded)`.
  - **7 token cards** (`WickenFamiliarCard`, Token, in `Cards/Familiar/`): Plague, Quills, Hibernate,
    Mutilate, Scout, Laze, Rats.
  - **Pocket Rats** (Rats×3 → hand) and **Broom Strike** (15 dmg + `NextFamiliarFreePower` from Phase 0).
  - **Deferred:** Wolf Familiar + Gnash (Pack Tactics = Open Q2); Chimera Familiar / Woe and Whimsy
    (need a random-familiar-token registry); Find Familiar / Pact of Beasts (pile tutor/search by
    "is a familiar card"); Embrace the Wilds (hand transform + make free). Pillage / Stampede / Ritual
    Sacrifice are now **unblocked** (Q1 familiar-count done) but not yet built.

## Per-card workflow (what "done" means for each)

1. C# card class in `TheWickenCode/Cards/` (familiar token-cards go in `Cards/Familiar/`).
2. Placeholder `big/<snake_name>.png` (copy of `big/card.png`) so art loads with the right name.
3. Localization `title` + `description` in `TheWicken/localization/eng/cards.json` with correct dynamic-var tokens.
4. Pool/rarity correct (`WickenCard` → main pool; familiar/token cards → `WickenFamiliarCard`, `Token` rarity).

**Image filename = `snake_case` of the class name.** e.g. class `BrambleShield` → id `THEWICKEN-BRAMBLE_SHIELD`
→ loads `card_portraits/big/bramble_shield.png` and `card_portraits/bramble_shield.png`. Missing files fall
back to `card.png` and log (see `StringExtensions.BigCardImagePath`), so placeholders are low-risk.

## Status legend

- ⬜ Not started
- 🟦 Ready — uses only existing infra, can implement immediately
- 🟧 Blocked — needs new shared infra first (see Phase 0)
- ❓ Design undefined — needs a decision before it can be built (see Open Questions)
- MP — multiplayer-only card: `MultiplayerConstraint => CardMultiplayerConstraint.MultiplayerOnly`
  (ref `Flanking`); auto-excluded from single-player pools

## Phase 0 — Shared infrastructure (build FIRST, unblocks most cards)

These are reused across many cards. Order roughly by how many cards they unblock.

### 0a. Counters (turn/combat-scoped trackers)
| Counter | Scope | Cards that need it | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BramblesCreatedThisTurn` | turn | Bramble Shield | ✅ DONE — `CombatHistoryQueries` (PowerReceived log) |
| `PotionsUsedThisTurn` | turn | Bottle Wall | ✅ DONE — `CombatHistoryQueries` (PotionUsed log) |
| `PotionsCreatedThisCombat` | combat | Bottle Barrage | ⬜ TODO — **no history entry for potion procurement**; needs a small tracker (combat-start-applied counter power, or Harmony patch on `PotionCmd` procurement). Decide when building Bottle Barrage. |
| `FamiliarCount` | combat | Pillage, Stampede | ✅ DONE — `Familiars.Count` over `FamiliarPower` stacks (Q1 resolved) |

Implementation: likely a hidden/counter `WickenPower` per tracker (StackType.Counter), incremented
from the relevant hook. Base-game pattern: counter powers + `AfterPlayerTurnEnd`/`BeforeCombatStart` resets.

### 0b. Brambles upgrades (edit existing `BramblesPower`) — ✅ DONE
- **Vicious Barbs** → `ViciousBarbsPower` built; `BramblesPower` adds its amount to each retaliation.
- **Hedge Prison** → `HedgePrisonPower` built; `BramblesPower` skips `PowerCmd.Decrement` when present.
- Both powers + loc done. The cards themselves are still TODO but are now trivial one-line
  `PowerCmd.Apply<...>` Power cards (Phase 2).

### 0c. Trigger powers ("Whenever you …")
**No shared base needed** — each is a one-hook `WickenPower` built with its card (Phase 3). Listed here
only so the hooks are known. Reference base-game powers in `gamedata/src/Core/Models/Powers/`.
| Power card | Hook | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Rotting Roots | after a debuff is applied (by player) | gain N brambles |
| Bottomless Cauldron | after another potion is used | create a Wicked Brew |
| Bitter Root | after a potion is used | gain N brambles |
| Cloak of Moonlight | after a card or potion is created | gain N block |
| Cursed Bloodline | after player loses life | gain N brambles |

### 0d. Conditional cost reduction — ✅ DONE
- `Powers/NextSkillDiscountPower.cs` — next Skill costs 1 (Math.Min, only ever a discount). Weathered Witch Hat.
- `Powers/NextFamiliarFreePower.cs` — next `IFamiliarSummon` card costs 0. Broom Strike.
- Both mirror base-game `FreeSkillPower`/`FreePowerPower`: discount in `TryModifyEnergyCostInCombatLate`,
  consume in `BeforeCardPlayed` (runs before the applying card's play → no self-consume). Loc added.
  Cards still TODO but are now trivial (`PowerCmd.Apply<>` + the block/damage half).

### 0e. Potion helpers (partly DONE — rest deferred to their cards)
- ✅ **Offensive / Utility / Defensive potion creation** — already have `PotionCatalog.Query(trait, …)`
  (see `StoneSkin`). Reuse for Something Wicked, Toil and Trouble, Stone Skin pattern.
- **Rarity-up on create** ("next potion higher quality" / "+1 rarity") — Gather Herbs needs a
  `NextPotionUpgraded` buff; several upgrades read "potion is 1 rarity higher".
- **Rock potion** = base-game `PotionShapedRock` (already `Token` rarity) — used by Rattling Bottles.
- **Destroy potions + payoff** — Herbal Remedy / Unstable Reaction need a "discard/destroy all belt
  potions, count them" helper.

### 0f. Familiar system extensions
- ✅ **Core built** (see Progress log): `FamiliarPower` + `Familiars` helper + `GainFamiliar<>()`.
  Familiar count, sacrifice, and per-type tracking all run off this.
- **New familiars** (Power cards that add token-cards + summon a cosmetic pet, like `OwlFamiliar`):
  Rat, Chimera, Porcupine, Bear, Crow, Wolf, Sloth. Each needs: a `XFamiliarPower` + loc, a
  `GainFamiliar<XFamiliarPower>()` call in `OnPlay`, and may need a `WickenPet` sprite (currently
  only Owl/Cat pets exist) — placeholder pet or reuse generic.
- **New token cards** (all `WickenFamiliarCard`, `Token` rarity, in `Cards/Familiar/`):
  Plague, Quills, Hibernate, Mutilate, Scout, Gnash, Laze, Rats. (Existing: Ferocity, Wisdom.)
- **Pack Tactics** mechanic (Wolf/Gnash) — **❓ undefined, see Open Q2**.
- **Familiar card search / gather** — Find Familiar (tutor from draw), Pact of Beasts (all familiar
  cards from piles → hand), Embrace the Wilds (transform hand → random familiars).
- **Sacrifice a familiar** — Ritual Sacrifice — **❓ depends on Open Q1 familiar definition**.

## Phased rollout (recommended order)

1. **Phase 1 — 🟦 quick wins** (no new infra): ✅ **DONE** (16 cards — see Progress log). Serrated Bones,
   Lavender and Sage, Nettles, Brambleburst, Wild Growth, Needle Whip, Forbidden Magic, Stuck in the
   Bush, Moondrop Tea, Hexburst, Something Wicked, Toil and Trouble, Blood Boiling, Rattling Bottles,
   Bag of Teeth, Hidden in Smoke. Art/loc/class pipeline validated at volume.
2. **Phase 2 — Brambles infra (0a/0b) + dependent cards**: ✅ **DONE**. Infra was built in Phase 0;
   cards Bramble Shield, Vicious Barbs, Hedge Prison shipped (see Progress log).
3. **Phase 3 — Trigger powers (0c)**: ✅ **DONE**. Rotting Roots, Cursed Bloodline, Bind in Blood,
   Bottomless Cauldron, Bitter Root, Cloak of Moonlight (see Progress log).
4. **Phase 4 — Potion infra (0e) + counters**: ✅ **5/8 DONE** (Dance Around the Cauldron, Bottle Wall,
   Herbal Remedy, Unstable Reaction, Roomy Satchel). ⬜ Deferred: Gather Herbs, Bottle Barrage,
   Witch's Curse (see Progress log for why).
5. **Phase 5 — Familiars (0f)**: ✅ **mostly DONE** — 5 familiars (Rat/Porcupine/Bear/Crow/Sloth) + 7
   token cards + Pocket Rats + Broom Strike. ⬜ Deferred: Wolf (Q2), Chimera, Woe and Whimsy, Find
   Familiar, Pact of Beasts, Embrace the Wilds.
6. **Phase 6** — ✅ Familiar-count trio **DONE** (Pillage, Stampede, Ritual Sacrifice — `Familiars.Count`
   / `Familiars.RemoveRandom`). ⬜ Still gated on decisions: Pack Tactics (Wolf/Gnash, Q2), Rancid Smoke
   (Q4), Cackle/The Cauldron (Q5); plus co-op cards (Circle of Rot, Tiny Bottle, Share the Brew,
   Creeping Vines — need ally-targeting impl) and random-familiar utility (Chimera, Woe and Whimsy, Find
   Familiar, Pact of Beasts, Embrace the Wilds — need a familiar-card registry + pile search/transform).

### 2026-06-26 (Phase 6 partial)
Pillage / Stampede / Ritual Sacrifice built on the Q1 familiar system, 0/0. Stampede = `WithHitCount(Familiars.Count)`;
Pillage draws per familiar; Ritual Sacrifice = `Familiars.RemoveRandom` then block only if one was sacrificed.

---

## Open design questions (need user decisions)

- **Q1 — What is a "familiar"? ✅ RESOLVED.** Each familiar type grants one stack of an associated
  `FamiliarPower` (e.g. playing Owl Familiar → +1 `OwlFamiliarPower`). Total familiar count = sum of
  all `FamiliarPower` stacks. Sacrifice = pick a random familiar power and decrement it (auto-removed
  at 0). Built — see Progress log / `Powers/Familiars.cs`.
- **Q2 — Pack Tactics (Wolf / Gnash):** "all Pack Tactics deal +5 dmg." Define the keyword: does
  playing one Gnash buff the rest in hand? Is "Pack Tactics" a tag shared by all wolf tokens? Need
  the exact rule.
- **Q3 — Multiplayer "ally" cards. ✅ RESOLVED.** Circle of Rot, Tiny Bottle, Share the Brew, Creeping
  Vines are **multiplayer-only**: override `MultiplayerConstraint => CardMultiplayerConstraint.MultiplayerOnly`
  (base-game ref: `Flanking`). The game auto-excludes them from single-player reward/shop pools, so no
  single-player fallback logic is needed. Build them with their full co-op ally behavior.
- **Q4 — Rancid Smoke "spread all of YOUR debuffs":** does the Wicken accumulate debuffs on herself
  that this then copies to all enemies? Confirm source = player's own debuffs.
- **Q5 — "The Cauldron" (Cackle):** undefined ("a big potion that does something really big"). Needs
  a concrete effect + rarity before build.
- **Minor:** "Wicked Brew" capitalization in loc (existing key is `WickedBrew`/"Wicked Brew"); keep
  consistent. Several upgrades say "-1 energy" on already-cheap cards — confirm intended floors.
