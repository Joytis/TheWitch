# Card Tag Taxonomy — `sub` and `threads`

Every card in `Docs/card-data/{cards,silent,necrobinder,ironclad,defect,regent}.json` carries two
curated tag arrays beyond the original `mechanics[]`/`role[]`:

- **`sub[]`** — *sub-archetype* within a class pillar, named `Pillar:SubName` (e.g. `Potions:Brew`,
  `Poison:Engine`). Class-scoped: splits each pillar into its functionally distinct wings
  (generate vs spend vs engine vs payoff). A sub-archetype needs ≥2 member cards to exist.
- **`threads[]`** — *cross-class functional threads* from the shared vocabulary below. These are
  the axes on which pools are directly comparable (how much AoE does each class get, who has
  draw engines, who pays costs in HP vs cards vs tempo).

Both fields are **curated** (hand/agent-audited against card text and the decompiled source) and
**preserved across regens** by `regen.js` / `gen-basegame.js`, keyed by `entry` — exactly like
`mechanics`/`role`. When a card's *mechanics* change, re-audit its tags (the `card-db-update`
skill covers this).

Provenance: taxonomy mined 2026-07 by a per-class audit of all 539 cards (6 pools), with
keyword ground-truthing against `gamedata/` decompiled `CanonicalKeywords`/`CanonicalStarCost`
(the JSON `text` field does NOT include keyword lines — see Data-quality notes).

applies Frail; `Scry` — no scry mechanic in StS2 base pools; `SelfDamage` — folded into `HPLoss`.

## Sub-archetypes per class

Format: `Pillar:Sub` — definition (count).

- `Vigor:Gain` (2) — vestigial, no payoff.

## Data-quality notes (affect any text-derived analysis)

1. **The base-game JSON `text` field drops `CanonicalKeywords`** — Sly, Exhaust, Innate, Retain
   are invisible (~25 Silent cards alone). Untouchable reads as an unplayable "2-cost 6 Block"
   but is Sly. Regent star costs are likewise absent from text (5 cards). The `threads` tags
   carry this ground truth now; if numeric efficiency comparison is built, remember self-exhaust
   and star-cost cards are deliberately above-rate.
2. **Hex** (Witch): +3 damage per stack on EVERY hit of an incoming attack, −1 stack per attack —
   every multi-hit card is an incidental Hex payoff.
3. **Sly** (Silent): auto-plays when discarded; Tactician/Reflex/Untouchable are deliberately
   overcosted because their real rate is the free discard-triggered play.
